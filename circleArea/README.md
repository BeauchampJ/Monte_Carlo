# circleArea
## A program that estimates the area of a circle using a Monte Carlo Simulation
---
# Inputs:
-   r: Radius of circle we are calculating
-   points: The number of points the user wants to randomly place drop to calculate area

# Outputs:
-   area: The area calculated from the simulation
-   error: The absolute error between our estimate and our actual area
